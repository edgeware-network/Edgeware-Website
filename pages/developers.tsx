            Edgeware aims to solve the scalability problem by adopting a fundamentally different
            architecture. Edgeware token holders can vote to upgrade the network using on-chain
            voting, after which nodes automatically download a new version of the runtime. Critical
            decisions are made on-chain, creating a system with lower coordination overhead and a
            transparent process for deciding upon improvements.

                  In Edgeware, working groups function as mission-based development orgs that are
                  composed of members who share interests, needs, and passions. Where an Ambassador
                  team is largely formed to promote a network in a variety of ways, Working Groups
                  are intended to solve issues specific to a community while also growing community.

                  Edgeware is a smart contract blockchain that compiles to a client runtime, a blob
                  of <strong>WebAssembly (Wasm)</strong> code that may be built and run natively or
                  executed within a Wasm virtual machine. Either way, when an Edgeware native binary
                  is compiled, it includes a Wasm virtual machine which can be used to execute later
                  versions of the client runtime downloaded from the network.
                </P>
                <P secondary>
                  The client runtime interfaces with networking code and other components provided
                  by <strong>Parity Substrate</strong>. Substrate includes{' '}
                  <strong>
                    libp2p networking, PBFT consensus, proof-of-stake block validation and finality
                    [substrate]
                  </strong>
                  . Ultimately, the client is only responsible for downloading, executing, and
                  validating blocks from the network.
